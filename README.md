# Personal website

This is my personal website, built with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Design rationale

I've seen really cool portfolio/personal sites, including games, entire operating systems and so on.

Why is it my site so simple then?

I wanted a design that was easy to maintain, felt techy, and would allow me to focus on the content of the site.
